# Custom Object-Detection Using Jetson-Inference
This github repo focuses on implementing custom object detection on the jetson nano, by using Jetson-inference by HelloAI World, Dusty.

By using this method it is easier to annotate custom datasets and obtain pre-trained datasets for your projects.

These are the list of things that we will cover:
1) Installation
2) Obtaining datasets
3) Training custom models
4) Creating the onnx file
5) Launching your own object detection program
6) Writing your own custom object detection program in python
7) References
