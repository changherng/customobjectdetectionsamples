# Custom Object-Detection Using Jetson-Inference
This github repo focuses on implementing custom object detection on the jetson nano, by using Jetson-inference by HelloAI World, Dusty.
Huge thanks to Dusty and feel free to use anything available here as you wish.

By using this method it is easier to annotate custom datasets and obtain pre-trained datasets for your projects.

These are the list of things that we will cover:
1) Installation
2) Obtaining datasets
3) Training custom models
4) Creating the onnx file
5) Launching your own object detection program
6) Writing your own custom object detection program in python
7) References


To get custom datasets online, [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/visualizer/index.html?set=train&type=detection&c=%2Fm%2F0fp6w) has over 600 
different classes of objects for you to choose from.












Other projects that you can work on a jetson nano are face detection or recognition using haarcascade for higher fps but sacrificing accuracy.
